# The game's frame ratio. Once a frame the function at main+0x6e6be0 (v131072) divides its base rate (60.0, or 30.0 while bit 0 of [x21+0x24f] is set) by the int frame rate at
# [x21+0x2c8] (fdiv s8,s1,s0 at +0xe4) and hands the result to the time object (main+0x3b4e300: ratio at +0x10, 1 / ratio at +0x14, round(60 / ratio) at +0x1c), which the game
# steps by; the frame's own time never enters it, so a frame that takes two vsyncs at rate 60 plays at half speed. The stub gives the ratio the host's step instead: step × base / 60
# (the division's value when the host keeps frames 60 / rate vsyncs), and counts the vsyncs stepped. Until the host has decided a step, and at fps_target 0, the division runs.
# s0 and x16 / x17 are free there (s0 is written again on every path before it is read; the function uses neither x16 nor x17); s1 keeps the base rate.
# Lichii (a GPL emulator; only the fact was taken) found the division (its notes: main+0x6E6CC4, 60 / [x21+0x2C8])

# The game's dynamic resolution (game__gfx__DynamicResolutionParam: LoadThreshold, ReduceCounterMax, IncreaseCounterMax and a list of levels, each a ResolutionReduceScale and a
# Priority). Its controller's update (main+0x805aa0, v131072) reads the frame's GPU time, subtracts what its cost model predicts at the current size and keeps the residual's trend;
# the level function (main+0x8065e0) adds that residual to the model's cost at each level and returns the best level that stays under the threshold, 0 (the full size, 1536x864)
# when the current size does; the update moves to a lower level after ReduceCounterMax frames that ask for it and back up after IncreaseCounterMax. Its scale divides the 3D views.
# On the Mac the GPU holds 1536x864 within a 60 fps frame, yet the controller sat at 683x384 for minutes after a loading screen (game note, Dynamic resolution). With
# DM_DYNAMIC_RESOLUTION 0 (the default; state +0x40 0) the stub makes the level function return 0, so the update climbs to full resolution and stays; 1 runs the game's function.
# The function is a leaf: x16 / x17 are free at its entry, and w0 is its only result (the original also stores the predicted cost at +0x18, which only this function and the update's
# own decision read)

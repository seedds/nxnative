# The game's frame ratio. Once a frame the function at main+0x6e6be0 (v131072) divides its base rate (60.0, or 30.0 while bit 0 of [x21+0x24f] is set) by the int frame rate at
# [x21+0x2c8] (fdiv s8,s1,s0 at +0xe4) and hands the result to the time object (main+0x3b4e300: ratio at +0x10, 1 / ratio at +0x14, round(60 / ratio) at +0x1c), which the game
# steps by; the frame's own time never enters it, so a frame that takes two vsyncs at rate 60 plays at half speed. The stub gives the ratio the host's step instead: step × base / 60
# (the division's value when the host keeps frames 60 / rate vsyncs), and counts the vsyncs stepped. Until the host has decided a step, and at fps_target 0, the division runs.
# s0 and x16 / x17 are free there (s0 is written again on every path before it is read; the function uses neither x16 nor x17); s1 keeps the base rate.
# Lichii (a GPL emulator; only the fact was taken) found the division (its notes: main+0x6E6CC4, 60 / [x21+0x2C8])

# The game's dynamic resolution (game__gfx__DynamicResolutionParam: LoadThreshold, ReduceCounterMax, IncreaseCounterMax and a list of levels, each a ResolutionReduceScale and a
# Priority; on v131072 levels 0..9 at 0.75..0.333 of 2048x1152, 1536x864 to 683x384). Its update (main+0x805aa0) reads the frame's GPU load (about 0.2 ms a unit) into +0x8, subtracts
# its small model of the fixed costs and divides the rest by the square of the current scale: it takes the rest of the frame's cost to grow with the pixel count, as on the Switch 2
# its constants were tuned for. The level function (main+0x8065e0) adds that back times each level's scale squared and returns the best level under the threshold (+0x10, 83 = about
# 16.4 ms). On Apple GPUs this game's cost hardly depends on the resolution (mesh, compute and the upscaler's fixed 2048x1152 dominate): 683x384 cost 14.3 ms and 1536x864 14.7 ms on
# an M4 Pro, yet at 683x384 the extrapolation put 1536x864 at about 300 units against the 83 it allows, so the controller sat at its floor for good (game note, Dynamic resolution).
# The stub replaces the level function. With DM_DYNAMIC_RESOLUTION 0 (the default; state +0x40 0) it returns 0: full resolution. With 1 it climbs on what was measured at each
# level, with no model of how the cost grows: one level down when the load (+0x8) has been over the threshold for 8 calls in a row, and that level is marked as not fitting; one level
# up when the load fits and the level above was never measured, fitted when it was last measured, or was measured more than 600 calls (about 10 s) ago; else the current level
# (+0x174). Nothing is decided or recorded until a level has held 8 calls: the load is read a few frames late, so before that it may be the previous level's. The 8 calls over in a
# row keep a single slow frame, or the first frames at a new size (its render targets), from marking a level that fits (on the full library at level 1: one burst to 90 against loads
# of 77-80 at levels 2 and 1). The game's counters still pace the steps (down after ReduceCounterMax frames, up after IncreaseCounterMax); its level count (+0x1a0) is the floor.
# The memory is in the state page: +0x200 calls, +0x204 the last call's level, +0x208 calls at it, +0x20c calls over in a row, +0x210 the load measured at each level (16 floats),
# +0x250 the call it was measured at (0 = never). Run against a model of the update (a level moves after the stub asked 5 times up or 2 times down; the load two frames late): a load
# of 70 at every level climbs from the floor to full size in 9 steps, as does Ocarina's measured 72-80 with a spike every 37 frames and a burst after each change; a load that grows
# with the pixel count settles at the highest level that fits and tries the one above once per 600 calls; a scene that gets lighter climbs again, a heavier one steps down.
# The function is a leaf: x2..x11, x16, x17 and s0..s2 are free, w0 its only result (the original also stores its predicted cost at +0x18, which only it and the update's own
# decision read). The update's fingerprint is required too: +0x8 and +0x174 are its fields
